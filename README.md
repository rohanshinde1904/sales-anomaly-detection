# sales-anomaly-detection

ðŸ›’ Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms generate large-scale sales data across multiple sources, including:

â€¢	Websites

â€¢	Mobile apps

â€¢	Third-party APIs

â€¢	Warehouses

â€¢	Payment systems


________________________________________


This data is critical for business decisions but often contains unexpected anomalies, such as:

â€¢	Sudden spikes in orders

   1. Fraudulent activity (e.g., fake or bulk orders)
    
   2. Flash promotions or marketing campaigns
  
â€¢	Sharp drops in sales
  
   1. System outages or checkout failures
    
   2.	Stockouts or inventory issues
  
â€¢	Irregular patterns
  
   1. Seasonal trends not accounted for
    
   2. Unexpected marketing or operational events

ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a scalable, end-to-end data engineering pipeline that:
1.	Ingests sales data from multiple sources
    -	CSV, Parquet, APIs, or Kafka streams
2.	Cleans and validates the data
    -	Schema enforcement
    -	Null checks and data quality rules
3.	Aggregates data
    -	Daily, weekly, and product-level sales
    -	Handles missing or duplicate records
4.	Detects anomalies
    -	Statistical methods: Z-score, IQR
    -	ML-based methods: Isolation Forest, ARIMA, or Prophet
5.	Stores results
    -	Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers in Delta Lake
    -	Supports time-travel and versioning
6.	Visualizes and alerts
    -	Databricks dashboards or Power BI
    -	Automated notifications for detected anomalies
