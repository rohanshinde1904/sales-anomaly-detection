## 🛒 Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms generate large-scale sales data across multiple sources, including:

- Websites
- Mobile apps
- Third-party APIs
- Warehouses
- Payment systems

This data is critical for business decisions but often contains unexpected anomalies, such as:

### 🔹 Sudden spikes in orders
- Fraudulent activity (e.g., fake or bulk orders)
- Flash promotions or marketing campaigns

### 🔹 Sharp drops in sales
- System outages or checkout failures
- Stockouts or inventory issues

### 🔹 Irregular patterns
- Seasonal trends not accounted for
- Unexpected marketing or operational events

## 🎯 Goal

Build a **scalable, end-to-end data engineering pipeline** that:

1. **Ingests sales data from multiple sources**
   - CSV, Parquet, APIs, or Kafka streams
2. **Cleans and validates the data**
   - Schema enforcement, null checks, and data quality rules
3. **Aggregates data**
   - Daily, weekly, and product-level sales
   - Handles missing or duplicate records
4. **Detects anomalies**
   - Statistical methods: Z-score, IQR
   - ML-based methods: Isolation Forest, ARIMA, Prophet
5. **Stores results**
   - Bronze → Silver → Gold layers in Delta Lake
   - Supports time-travel and versioning
6. **Visualizes and alerts**
   - Databricks dashboards or Power BI
   - Automated notifications for detected anomalies

## 📌 Business Impact

- Early detection of anomalies prevents:
  - Revenue loss
  - Operational inefficiencies
  - Fraud exposure
- Provides actionable insights for business and operational teams
